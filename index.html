The ever looming question of graduates these days! Should I go for masters?
Masters in USA ofcourse!!!!
I was on and off seriously debating about that for atleast couple of months. I could never really come to a conclusion. 
Reason 1. For a fact I know I am bad at decision making!
Reason 2. I really dont know what i want.
Off the beat I just realised while writing this , i over think(go on loops thinking about the same thing) not critically think!
I realiazed , that i think a lot in bits and pieces. In such a case to make a clear decision one needs to write it down and nail to down to breaking point.
Pros of Going to USA:
1. I wake up , a lot of days and feel like shit to go to work and constant pressure of reporting to someone or some deadline(which has stakes) 
is clearly tiresome. I just want a break and go to clg to have some fun.
2. Will get some time to learn basic computer science and also develop something with peace , so that i will learn software enginerring.
3.
