The ever looming question of graduates these days! Should I go for masters?
Masters in USA ofcourse!!!!
I was on and off seriously debating about that for atleast couple of months. I could never really come to a conclusion. 
Reason 1. For a fact I know I am bad at decision making!
Reason 2. I really dont know what i want.
Off the beat I just realised while writing this , i over think(go on loops thinking about the same thing) not critically think!
I realiazed , that i think a lot in bits and pieces. In such a case to make a clear decision one needs to write it down and nail to down to breaking point.
Pros of Going to USA:
1. I wake up , a lot of days and feel like shit to go to work and constant pressure of reporting to someone or some deadline(which has stakes) 
is clearly tiresome. I just want a break and go to clg to have some fun.
2. Will get some time to learn basic computer science and also develop something with peace , so that i will learn software enginerring.
3. Until now , I have a proven track record doing things by workign very hard (Reflected in my final year thesis,  my first year job performance).
I always found it hard to add something new (or create something impactful). Doing research and writing paper are hell to me. I want to learn them!
4. Can do a road trip from west cost to east coast lmaoo!!!
5. My leadership skills are super bad. Secondly, my personal relationship with any collogues or generally frnds is bad. 
Mainly people dont like me , i dont get a frndly vibe ever. I want to focus on this aspect
6. I dont know what to talk to people even my close frnd or parents or to the people who I want to date. Mainly comes from the fact of I cannt find a solution or think solutions for many things.
